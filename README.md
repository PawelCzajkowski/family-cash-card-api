# Goal

The goal is to create a simple RESTful API for CashCard application which has CRUD operations.

To achieve it I used Spring and Spring Boot with Spring Web dependecy.
The security layer is made with Spring Security dependency, which automatically set basic authentication (username and password).

This project was implemented in TDD approach.
